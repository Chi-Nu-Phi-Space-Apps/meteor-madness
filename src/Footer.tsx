      <h3>About Our Project</h3>
      <p>We used a variety of complex math equations to find an approximation of where the asteroids will impact as well as impact energy, impact speed, and more using the data from the Nasa NEO API. We took the coordinates from our algorithm and mapped it to a map of the world in order to mark down where the meteor will impact.</p>
